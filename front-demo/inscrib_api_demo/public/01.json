The recent panic attack, characterized by physical symptoms such as chest tightness and difficulty breathing, represents a significant escalation of his anxiety and has understandably caused him distress. Despite these challenges, David demonstrates several strengths and coping mechanisms. He is proactive in seeking help and has already begun attending mental health workshops to learn new strategies for managing his anxiety. He is also highly disciplined and organized, which has allowed him to maintain his concentration and productivity at work despite the emotional turmoil he is experiencing. His passion for Ironman triathlon training has provided him with a healthy outlet for stress relief and a sense of accomplishment, although he acknowledges that his training has been impacted by his current circumstances."
